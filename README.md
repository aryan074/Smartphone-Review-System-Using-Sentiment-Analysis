Smartphone Review System Using Sentiment Analysis

Project Overview-
The Smartphone Review System Using Sentiment Analysis is a machine learning–based application developed to analyze customer reviews of smartphones and classify them according to sentiment. The system processes textual reviews and determines whether the expressed opinion is positive, negative, or neutral, enabling manufacturers and customers to understand public perception of smartphone products.
This project demonstrates the practical application of Natural Language Processing and machine learning techniques for opinion mining and decision support.

Objectives-
•	To automatically analyze smartphone reviews
•	To classify reviews based on sentiment polarity
•	To provide insight into customer feedback using data-driven techniques

Technologies Used-
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Machine Learning Libraries: Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas
•	Natural Language Processing: NLTK
•	Visualization: Matplotlib
•	Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Python IDE

System Features-
•	Text pre-processing including tokenization, stop-word removal, and stemming
•	Feature extraction using TF-IDF vectorization
•	Supervised machine learning model for sentiment classification
•	Evaluation of model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix
•	Graphical representation of sentiment distribution
